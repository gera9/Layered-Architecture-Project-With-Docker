How is it composed?

* The firt container runs MongoDB from the `mongo` image and use its respective volume to the data persistence.
* The second container runs a MongoDB DMBS: `mongo-express`. It's protected by using a basic authentication. Their credentials are:
  * User: foo
  * Password: bar123 
* The third container is named generator. This container inserts 1000 records to the `MongoDB` database obtained of a XML file. We use Python.
* The fourth container is an API. We use Node.JS and Express. We structure our project by using the software design pattern. It's divided mainly in three parts:
  * Controllers: 
  * Routes:
  * Models: 
* The fifth container runs Angular. This container builds (for production) the angular project and then run it with `Nginx` on the port 4200.
